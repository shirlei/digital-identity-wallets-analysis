## Provision

Upon receiving the credential offer, users can accept it and have it stored in their wallet.

### Privacy considerations

1. The wallet application requires a PIN to be entered for access and can also be set up to utilise the device's biometric unlocking feature.


## Usage, Update and Maintainance

Users can present the VC in use cases like booking a study room or buying online with student discounts.

After reading the QR code, users receive a hint about the operation:

A valid VC is pre-selected for user to share.

After sharing, the requested info is shown in the web form of the verifier:

The user is now validated and can finish the booking.

### Privacy considerations

1. Users receive a notice/hint about the operation being performed.
2. If more than one valid credential is on the wallet, one is pre-selected and the user is provided with a 'change credential' option. Needs further analysis is this could lead users to share unintended VCs.
   

## De-provision

Users can remove a credential from the wallet.
